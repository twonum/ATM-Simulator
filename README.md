## ATM Simulator with GUI and Database Integration

### üöÄ **Project Overview**

This project is a comprehensive ATM simulator application built with Python, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and PyODBC for database connectivity. It provides a simulated ATM experience with functionalities such as user sign-up, sign-in, deposit, withdrawal, password reset, and account deletion. The application interacts with a SQL Server database to manage user data and transactions.

### üîß **Features**

- **User Authentication**:
  - **Sign-Up**: Create a new account with a username and password.
  - **Sign-In**: Log in to an existing account.
  - **Password Reset**: Update the password for an existing account.
  - **Account Deletion**: Permanently delete a user account.

- **Account Management**:
  - **Deposit**: Add funds to the user‚Äôs account balance.
  - **Withdraw**: Withdraw funds from the user‚Äôs account balance.
  - **Balance Display**: View the current balance of the account.

- **Database Integration**:
  - **SQL Server Database**: Store user credentials and balance information.
  - **CRUD Operations**: Perform create, read, update, and delete operations using SQL queries executed via PyODBC.

- **User Interface**:
  - **Sign-Up and Sign-In Forms**: Simple and intuitive forms for user interaction.
  - **Main ATM Screen**: Displays balance and allows deposit and withdrawal operations.
  - **Responsive Design**: Adjustments and feedback for user interactions.

### üí° **Skills Demonstrated**

- **Python Programming**: Utilized core programming concepts, functions, and flow control to develop the application.
- **Tkinter**: Designed and managed the GUI for a smooth user experience.
- **Database Management (SQL Server)**: Implemented SQL queries for managing user data.
- **PyODBC**: Established a connection to SQL Server and executed SQL queries.
- **Error Handling**: Incorporated error handling and user feedback through message boxes.
- **User Authentication**: Developed secure sign-up, sign-in, and password reset functionalities.
- **UI/UX Design**: Created a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with consistent design elements.
